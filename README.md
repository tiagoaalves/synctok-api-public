<p align="center">Welcome to SyncTok API ‚Äì a Spring Boot application designed to streamline the process of publishing short-form video content across multiple social media platforms. With SyncTok, you can upload once and publish to TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube simultaneously.</p>

<h2 id="technologies">üíª Technologies</h2>

- Java 22
- Spring Boot 3.2.3
- Spring Web
- Maven
- Cloudinary API
- TikTok API
- Instagram API
- YouTube API
- JSON Library (org.json)
- dotenv-java for environment variable management
- JUnit and Spring Boot Test for testing

<h2 id="started">üöÄ Getting Started</h2>

Here's how to set up SyncTok API locally.

<h3>Prerequisites</h3>

- [Java Development Kit (JDK) 22](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk22-archive-downloads.html)
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Cloudinary account](https://cloudinary.com/)
- API credentials for [TikTok](https://developers.tiktok.com/), [Instagram](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/), and [YouTube](https://developers.google.com/youtube)

<h3>Cloning</h3>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tiagoaalves/synctok-api.git
cd synctok-api
```

<h3>Config .env variables</h3>

Create a `.env` file in the project root from the `.env.example` with your API credentials.

<h3>Starting</h3>

To build and run the project:

```bash
./mvnw clean install
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:8080`.

| Route                                 | Description                            |
|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| <kbd>POST /api/v1/video/publish</kbd> | Publish a video to specified platforms |

<h3>POST /api/v1/video/publish</h3>

**REQUEST**

Multipart form data:
- `video`: The video file to upload
- `platforms`: Comma-separated list of platforms (e.g., "tiktok,instagram,youtube")

**RESPONSE**

```json
{
  "message": "Video successfully uploaded and published to TikTok, Instagram, YouTube"
}
```

<h2 id="documentation">üìö Documentation</h2>
This project does not implement the OAuth flow for any of the APIs. You will need to obtain the access tokens and account IDs from the respective platforms and provide them in the `.env` file. 
However, here's the [postman collection](https://github.com/tiagoaalves/synctok-api/blob/main/docs/postman-collection.json) I built while doing this, it might be helpful.

<h3>Running Tests</h3>

This project uses JUnit and Spring Boot Test for testing. To run the tests, use:

```bash
./mvnw test
```

<h3>Social Media Integrations</h3>

The integrations with TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube are implemented using custom clients that interact with each platform's API. These clients are not part of external libraries but are custom implementations within the project.

<b>Note:</b>
The application implements a basic retry mechanism for publishing media containers to Instagram. This feature addresses an occasional issue where the Instagram API returns a "Media ID is not available" error, indicating that the media container isn't quite ready for publishing.
Here's how our current implementation handles this:

It attempts to publish the media up to 5 times
Uses an exponential backoff strategy, starting with a 2-second delay and doubling it after each attempt
Catches specific "Media ID is not available" errors and initiates a retry
Throws a MediaPublishException if all retry attempts fail

This approach, while functional, is a bit of a quick fix. It gets the job done in most cases, but there's definitely room for improvement.

Thank you for checking out SyncTok API. I hope this project simplifies your multi-platform video publishing workflow!
